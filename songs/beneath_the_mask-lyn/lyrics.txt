Where have you been? Been searching all along
Came facing twilight, on and on, without a clue
Without a sign, without grasping, yet
The real question to be asked, where have I been?

I'm a shapeshifter at Poe's masquerade
Hiding both face and mind, all free for you to draw
I'm a shapeshifter, what else should I be?
Please don't take off my mask, revealing dark

Moments of calm, nothing left to be found
A mirror right in front of me, that's where I find
An empty glass, reflecting the sad truth
It's telling words not to be told, I need the mask

I'm a shapeshifter at Poe's masquerade
Hiding both face and mind, all free for you to draw
I'm a shapeshifter, chained down to my core
Please don't take off my mask, my place to hide

I can't tell you how to see me
Just a cage of bones, there's nothing inside
Will it unleash me, burning down the walls?
Is there a way for me to break?

I'm a shapeshifter at Poe's masquerade
Hiding both face and mind, all free for you to draw
I'm a shapeshifter have no face to show
Please don't take off my mask, my disguise
